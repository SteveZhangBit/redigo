package zset

// This package is the same of ZSETs in redis. The following instruction is copied from t_zset.c.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Sorted set API
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* ZSETs are ordered sets using two data structures to hold the same elements
 * in order to get O(log(N)) INSERT and REMOVE operations into a sorted
 * data structure.
 *
 * The elements are added to a hash table mapping Redis objects to scores.
 * At the same time the elements are added to a skip list mapping scores
 * to Redis objects (so objects are sorted by scores in this "view"). */
